### Postdoctoral Associates

We regularly have research opportunities for postdoctoral scientists who have experience in horticulture, plant quantitative genetics, breeding, plant pathology, or other related fields. Available opportunities will be posted [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news) or on related webpages. For more information, please [contact Jeff]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).

### Undergraduate Students and Interns

We welcome undergraduate students and interns from Rutgers University and other nearby institutions (including high schools) who are interested in gaining research experience in our lab. We are glad to provide and introduction and training in plant breeding and public research to interested students. If you are curious about a career in plant breeding and are interested in an opportunity, please [contact Jeff]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).


<!-- ### Graduate Students

Available graduate opportunities will be posted on the Clemson [Assistantship Openings](https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/plant-environmental-sciences/students/assistantships.html) site. Prospective students should apply through the Clemson Graduate School [Admissions](https://www.clemson.edu/graduate/admissions/apply/new-applicants.html) page. Students are expected to pursue support from intramural or extramural fellowships throughout their graduate tenure.

As a member of our group, graduate students will gain knowledge in phenomics as it applies to plant breeding and genetics. Collaborations across multi-disciplinary research groups will be expected. We provide training through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment. -->


<!-- ### Programmers

Our programming team is responsible for the code that goes into our apps, algorithms, and analytical pipelines. They are expected to maintain high standards of documentation, clarity, efficiency, and maintainability in their own code, and also help the other members of the lab achieve the same in their code. Job postings will be posted [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/news) or [Contact Jeff]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).
